## About
This website has been created for making the functioning of a society/association easier.
Due to the COVID-19  pandemic ,social gatherings are not possible and therefore  processes like collection of money,registering complaints of society members,taking suggestions,managing expenditures of society can’t be performed.
But these processes are important for functioning of a society and hence can’t be stopped.
So,this website gives solution to this problem by providing an online platform to carry out processes like these.
This website has the following functionalities :

- The users  can register their  complaints about anything to the admin.
- The users  can give suggestions about anything .
- the users  can make the payments online using this website .
- the users  can also maintain a track of their complaints and suggestions so that they know whether required actions were taken or not.
- the users  can also track the expenses of the society which makes the process really transparent because now the society members can see where and how the money is being spent.
- there’s a notification section as well where the society members can see all the important notifications.
- the website also provides a platform to all the society members to interact with each other by sending personal notification (complaints,suggestions or anything).
